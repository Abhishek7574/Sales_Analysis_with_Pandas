## Analysis and Hypothesis

- **December Sales Spike:** December is the month with the highest sales of $4,613,443.34. Hypothesis: The spike in sales could be attributed to the number of festivals and holidays during this month, leading to increased consumer spending on gifts and personal purchases.

- **San Francisco Sales Leadership:** San Francisco is the city with the highest sales. Hypothesis: Being a tech hub, San Francisco likely has a higher demand for mobile phones and accessories. The tech-savvy population and higher disposable income may contribute to the elevated sales figures.

- **Optimal Sales Times:** The highest sales occur between 10-11 AM and 6-8 PM. Hypothesis: These time slots may coincide with breaks during work hours and after-work leisure time when consumers are more likely to browse and make purchases online. These periods are ideal for targeted advertising.

- **Product Bundling Impact:** The most often sold together products are Phone and Charging Cable. Hypothesis: Bundling these complementary products together can enhance customer convenience and increase sales. Offering discounts or deals on these bundles can be an effective promotional strategy.

- **Top-Selling Products:** The most sold products are AAA Batteries (4-pack), AA Batteries (4-pack), and USB-C Charging Cable. Hypothesis: These products are likely top sellers due to their necessity and frequent need for replacement, making them essential accessories for a wide range of electronic devices.
